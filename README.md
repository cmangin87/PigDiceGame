Game Rules:

There are 2 players.  A player begins by rolling the die.  If the die is any number that is not "ONE" then that amount is added to their score.  If, however, a "ONE" is rolled, the player's score is reset to 0 and the next player's turn begins.

However, a player is able to "HOLD" their score by forfeitting their turn to the other player.

The first player to reach a score of 100 wins!
